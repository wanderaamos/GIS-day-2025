# GIS-day-2025
Thrive Together is a space where farmers, youth, elders, engineers, artists, and policymakers share how they experience climate challenges and envision adaptation. Through mapping sessions and workshops, participants analyze local risks and co-create solutions using GIS tools, data, and lived experience to build resilient futures.
